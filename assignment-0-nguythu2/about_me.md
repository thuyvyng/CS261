Name: Hi! My name is Thuy-Vy Nguyen. If it helps, it sounds like Twee-Vee Win.
Email: nguythu2@oregonstate.edu
Major: I am Computer Science and a second year.
Piazza?: Yes!
Unique about Me: I was a little too stressed about picking the most interestring thing I have done or the most interestring thing about me. So instead of that, here is a story about my one and only time I got a noise complaint in the dorms. Honestly, I am a little surprised it is my one and only. I am a very loud person, actually my RA once told me she is sure I was either the loudest or second loudest person in the West Hall last year. My only other competitor sings ophera in his free time so it is an intense debate. Anyways, apparently me showing my friends vines (i know the app is gone but it is still very important to my life) and laughing way too hard and way too loud violated quiet hours. But in my defense, vines are really funny.
